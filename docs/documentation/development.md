## Stub Files for Python Bindings
We use autogenerated python stub files (`.pyi`) in the [`_core`](python/rcs/_core/) folder to show our linters the expected types of the C++ Python bindings.
If the python bindings in the C++ code have changed you might need to regenerate them by using:
```shell
make stubgen
```
